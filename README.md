DiscordEditProfils: Detailed Guide
Program Description:
DiscordEditProfils is a tool written in Python using the Selenium library that allows users to automatically change their Discord profile status. The program is designed to automate the status update process, which can be useful for users who frequently update their statuses.

Current Version: v2

Known Bug:
In version v2, the program can edit an existing status but cannot add a new status. Therefore, before running main.py, you need to manually go to Discord, select the "Add Status" field, and enter any character.
